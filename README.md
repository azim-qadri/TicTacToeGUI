# TicTacToeGUI
**Tic Tac Toe Game with Images in Python using Tkinter**: A simple Tic Tac Toe game built in Python using Tkinter, where players can choose their moves with cross and zero images.
## Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using Python and the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface. The game allows two players to take turns and try to get three of their marks (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, to win the game. The game also detects if there's a draw when no player can win.
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface and the `PIL` library for working with images.

### Requirements

To run the game, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need the following libraries:

- `tkinter`: To create the GUI.
- `PIL`: To handle and display images.

### How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed by running the following commands:
   ```
   pip install tk
   pip install pillow
   ```
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located.
4. Run the following command to start the game:
   ```
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```
5. The Tic Tac Toe window will open, and you can start playing the game.

### Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Player 1 uses 'X', and Player 2 uses 'O'.
- Players take turns clicking on the available cells to place their symbols.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all the cells are filled and no player has three symbols in a row, the game ends in a draw.

### How to Play

1. When you start the game, a 3x3 grid will appear on the screen, representing the Tic Tac Toe board.
2. Player 1 starts the game by clicking on an empty cell where they want to place their 'X'.
3. Player 2 (or the computer) then takes their turn by clicking on another empty cell where they want to place their 'O'.
4. Players take turns until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.
5. If a player wins or the game ends in a draw, a message will be displayed on the screen.
6. To restart the game, simply close the window and run the game again.
